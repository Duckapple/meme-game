# Meme Game

![Banner image](docs/banner.png)

My buddy Mads has a lovely server which automatically generates classic Image Macro memes with a picture, a top text, and a bottom text, all based on user submissions.
This project is a game which uses his meme generator API to make a "put the best caption on the picture" type game.

## Development

In one shell, open this repository, navigate to `server/` and run `yarn dev`:

```sh
cd server
yarn dev
```

In another shell, navigate to `client` and run `yarn dev` there:

```sh
cd client
yarn dev
```

Deployment involves building each project via their respective `yarn build` commands
